								<p>I love knowing <em>why</em>, and I love to solve problems.</p>
								<p>After over a decade of leading in professional kitchens, I am taking my knowledge and experience of fast paced, high intensity situations, 
									and leveraging them into a new career that moves beyond sustainable and responsible hospitality. My passion has always been learning: 
									understanding the underlying mechanics of a task in order to improve and innovate. It's why I loved professional cooking, and it’s why 
									I’ve decided to pursue a role that blends data analysis, presentation, and project management. There’s something deeply satisfying about 
									being able to see how an outcome was reached, to really know it. Likewise, being able to pass that knowledge on to someone else and know 
									that you’ve equipped them to make the best possible choices - that’s powerful, and it’s rewarding. This is why I am so excited to be pursuing
									a role that applies analytical techniques and critical thinking alongside insightful observation and data storytelling: it's exactly where I 
									want to be and what I’ve been working towards.</p>

											<p>Our young Scottish Fold was having serious troubles and was going to need surgery 
												to remove an abnormally large stone from her bladder. One very long day and drugged up kitty later, Ailie was home safe and sound. 
												We were happy to know she would be ok, but how could we stop this from happening again?</p>
											<p>And just like that, we needed to take a very serious look at our cats' diets. Once we determined our nutritional requirements, we <i>assumed</i>
												it would be as simple as looking at some nutritional info on the sides of cans and picking the right numbers. The pet nutrition industry, however, 
												is not set up with an informed consumer in mind...</p>
											<p>This is a multi-program, functioning data pipeline for evaluating... cat food. Yeah. I know, it seems weird; but as it turns out this data set actually presents 
												a number of interesting challenges: non-standardized itemization, differing or mixed systems of measurement, unlisted values that we'll need to derive. What started off as 
												an afternoon on Excel quickly escalated, as the more I looked into this the more holes I uncovered. This was quickly becoming the biggest project I had even tackled.</p>
											<p>At the heart of this ongoing project are three key programs: spidercat, tidycat, and vizcat.</p>

											<p>Being able to rely on your team is critical to success in any environment and even the most humble role can become the bottleneck that halts production, 
											damaging morale and causing unforeseen difficulties. Onboarding new additions to the team and adjusting to new workflows takes time and resources: wouldn't it 
											be great to see these roadblocks coming and be able to plan for them? Nowhere is this more evident than in the dish pit of any commercial kitchen.</p>
											<p>Which is exactly the demonstration I was hoping for; however, my first hurdle was in hindsight an obvious one: most small scale restaurants (and I would 
											suspect, most small businesses) do not document even a fraction of the data they generate. In my case, the data I wanted to showcase simply wasn't available. 
											The obvious candidates - larger, corporate restaurant chains - doubtless conduct this style of analysis. And why wouldn't they? Any insights into knowing the 
											frequency of employee turnover will directly impact your hiring and retention strategies, contributing to minimizing labour costs and mitigating shortages</p>
											<p>In this project, I've used Python and scikit-learn to conduct employee turnover analysis to assess the churn within an organization, in an effort to predict and 
											reduce future employee turnover. Wages, incentives, workload, satisfaction and absenteeism - by modeling these variable interactions using Decision Trees and Random Forest, we can identify 
											the key variables that play a crucial role in retaining team members. By leveraging Jupyter widgets to build interactive graphical controls, the hyperparameters 
											of the feature importance plots can be modified on the fly; the results are generated in real time, and you gain immediate insights into the when and why.</p>
											<p>For now, the data set I am using is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set" target="_blank">Human Resources Data Set by Dr. Rich Huebner</a>, as hosted on Kaggle. 
											This data set offer a lot of metrics we might find in larger enterprise scale businesses; plus, as a training resource it also offered me an opportunity to 
											clean the data set myself!</p>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/projects/dishpit/datacleaning1.png" alt=""/></span>
											<p>In addition to the usual cleaning tasks, the data set included a number of features that weren't relevant to our analysis. We reformatted our DataFrame, dropping and reformatting the values for our algorithm.</p>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/projects/dishpit/datacleaning2.png" alt=""/><img src="images/projects/dishpit/datacleaning3.png" alt=""/></span>
											<p>The next step was an exploratory analysis to see exactly what we were dealing with. By uncovering simple relationships now, it will help us better interpret our model's findings.</p>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/dishpit/dataanalysis1.png" alt=""/></span>
											<p>Once I felt confident that I had a good handle on the data, I generated my training and validation sets. Both models in this project feature 
											interactive widgets for live tuning both the tree outputs and their accompanying Feature Importance charts.</p>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/projects/dishpit/dtree1.png" alt=""/><img src="images/projects/dishpit/interact1.png" alt=""/></span>
											<p>Lastly, I wanted to show some metrics for evaluating the models. I did this through a simple ROC visualization that outputs the AUC value to quickly compare iterations.</p>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/projects/dishpit/roc1.png" alt=""/></span>
											<p>If you've gotten all the way down here, I'd like to thank you for your time! I hope this project serves as a good example of how we can quickly implement machine learning techniques 
											to arrive at data-driven insights into the <i>why</i> of employee behavior, and how those insights can be used not only to forecast outcomes but also act as early warnings and increase 
											the overall retention of staff within an organization.</p>
